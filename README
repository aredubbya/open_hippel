Changed GitHub repo name to open_hippel

This repo should hold the different features modules that will make up Open Hippel.


hippel_discussion module

This is a feature export of the Discussion and Reply setup in Open Hippel.

hippel_redirect module

This is a simple module that calls on hook_init to check the node type, and redirect users after they had created a reply or commented on a reply, back to the main view of the referenced discussion node.
